FIRST MILESTONE PROJECT

Author: Kimberley Pearton

Introduction:
This is my first milestone project for the user centric front-end development module.
I have decided to use the materials provided by Code Institute and therefore my project is a website for The Monkees, a 1960s rock band,
that provides information to their fans including mini biographies of band members, past and upcoming concert dates, newsletter subscription,
a Spotify widget, soundtracks and a music video, and a contact form for users to hire the band for events. The website consists of five webpages.
I have used Bootstrap 3 to help make the website responsive with all screen sizes and also to take a mobile-first approach. 

Each page has a header and a footer, with a means of navigation in both, allowing the user to navigate the site at ease. 
"Home" includes:
    - Link to Amazon allowing the user to buy the album that is displayed above the link button.
    - Link to music.html for soundtracks
    - Link to contact.html for bookings
    - Newsletter subscription form
    - 'Daydream Believer' music video
    
"News" includes:
    - Information on past concerts with links to the venues that they took place in
    - An image (credit: George Bekich II/Las Vegas News Bureau via Getty Images) taken when the members performed at Green Valley Ranch on Aug. 10, 2013 in Las Vegas, Nevada
    - Newsletter subscription form
    - Information on upcoming concert dates with links directing user to the venue website that sells the tickets
    
"Music" includes:
    - Soundtracks provided by Code Institute, including 'Daydream Believer', 'Last Train To Clarksville', 'I'm A Believer' and 'Steppin Stone'.
    - Information on each soundtrack including an album cover
    
"About" includes:
    - Mini biographies on each member of The Monkees - Davy Jones, Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork.
    - Research has been collected from IMDB biographies, IMDB quotes, www.biography.com, www.allmusic.com and member websites.

"Contact" includes:
    - A form that users can complete to hire The Monkees to perform at a certain event.
    
Bugs:

Fixes:
    - Fixed box sizing for different device screen sizes
    - Removed gallery
    - Fixed image responsiveness with img-fluid
    - Amended media queries in style.css for better understanding
    - Fixed footer responsiveness
    
How I Tested My Project:
I tested out my project by using the Google Chrome developer tools - with this, I was able to see how my website responded on different screen sizes, and as a result of this, I was able
to fix several issues I was having with specific devices. I was also able to edit my CSS within the developer tools to see a live preview of my website before amending the CSS in style.css.
From the design brief provided, I researched The Monkees and found that my target audience would be in the age group of 50+, however, I did not exclude other age groups in the planning process.
To test the website fairly, I had three users of different age groups navigate through all of the web pages - as a results of this, a few bugs were found and fixed, including the images throughout
the web page not being responsive and the .box size also not being responsive.
    
Additional comments:
Throughout this project I have overcome various challenges, including trying to understand the Bootstrap grid system and how media queries work.

                            <p>While he was an apprentice, Davy Jones was encouraged to go into acting and got a role in a production 
                            of "Peter Pan". From there, he played on <em>Coronation Street</em> (1960) and <em>The Pickwick Papers</em>
                            (1952) before landing the role of "The Artful Dodger" in "Oliver!". This job took him to America's Broadway,
                            where he was discovered by Ward Sylvester and brought to Los Angeles. From there, he was given a role in
                            <em>The Monkees</em> (1966). Davy had gone on to perform in more plays, including "The Real Live Brady
                            Bunch" and "Oliver!" (again), and had also fulfilled his dream of becoming a jockey. He rejoined <em>The
                            Monkees</em> for touring from 1986-89 and 1996-97. Davy Jones died at age 66 of a heart attack on February 29, 2012.</p>

                            <p>Micky first established himself as a performer at age ten when, under the stage name of 'Micky Braddock,'
                            he starred in his first TV series, <em>Circus Boy</em>, which aired from 1956 to 1958. Micky auditioned for 
                            The Monkees TV show playing Chuck Berry's "Johnny B. Goode," and was chosen along with three other actors - Davy Jones,
                            Michael Nesmith, and Peter Tork. The Monkees' debut single, "Last Train to Clarksville," featuring Micky on
                            lead vocals, hit the charts September 10, 1966 and rocketed to number one. In early February 2016, news was 
                            officially released via Rhino Records that The Monkees (Micky with Peter Tork) would begin a tour in May in 
                            conjunction with their 50th anniversary. Also, a new album to be titled <em>Good Times</em> would be released, which 
                            would include participation from fellow original-Monkees member Michael Nesmith.</p>

                            <p>Most easily identified by his trademark bluish wool hat with pompom, Nesmith fashioned a diversified
                            career within music and also in film. When Nesmith won the role for The Monkees (1966) he was the first
                            of all involved to see where the show and the music would go. Nesmith produced tracks for The Monkees 
                            even before TV series filming began; he has said "about a hundred" tracks were made by himself, Micky,
                            Peter, and Davy in the first half of 1966, and among the songs recorded was his composition "The Girl 
                            I Knew Somewhere." In recent years, Nesmith has largely stayed out of the public eye.He continues 
                            to work on his own music and with other musicians.</p>

                            <p>Peter Tork performed as a folk musician in Greenwich Village - his luck and money
                            wore out by the mid-'60s, so he decided to head to Los Angeles, where he would eventually audition 
                            for the part of the guitarist for the Monkees; he also became known as the clown of the group. 
                            In addition to his work with the Monkees, Tork has released several solo albums. Cambria Hotel (2007)
                            is one of his most recent recordings. Tork has also explored his love of blues music. He performs with
                            his group called Shoe Suede Blues, which he formed in the 1990s.</p>
